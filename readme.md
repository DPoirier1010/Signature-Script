# Signature
This simple script will be use by my team to create signature faster than changing always the html file by hand.

The script ask for the number of users, then the console ask for information about that user and print it to an html file.
Right now, it's working for 2 or 1 user, which is already pretty good, but it's still broken in many ways. The user need to enter 
exactly what the script is waiting for (int, strings...)
Im using Jinja2 for the templates.

### I would like to add a GUI so it's easier for my support team to uses it.
